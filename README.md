# Todo List - MEAN Stack

Tutorial taken from:
http://www.bogotobogo.com/MEAN-Stack/MEAN-Stack-MongoDB-ExpressJS-AngularJS-NodeJS-ToDoList-App.php

In addition to getting familiar with the MEAN stack, I took the time to arrange the file structure in a way that I felt kept things organized.
That way everything was easy to find and understand as to what was backend and frontend interaction.
